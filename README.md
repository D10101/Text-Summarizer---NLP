## üìã Project Overview

The **Text Summarizer** is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based application that takes in long pieces of text and generates concise summaries. This tool is designed to help users extract key information quickly and efficiently, making the entire process of summarizing text both fun and easy.

## üöÄ Features

- **Automatic Text Summarization**: Provides a quick summary of long texts using NLP techniques.
- **Multiple Input Formats**: Supports plain text input, PDFs, and web page URLs.
- **Customizable Summary Length**: Allows users to define the desired length of the summary.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive to use.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `spaCy`: For NLP processing
  - `nltk`: For text preprocessing and summarization
  - `transformers`: For deep learning-based summarization (optional)
  - `Flask/Django`: For web-based deployment (optional)
  - `BeautifulSoup`: For extracting text from web pages (optional)
  - `PyPDF2`: For processing PDF files (optional)

## üí° How it Works

1. **Input Text**: Users input a long piece of text, PDF, or URL.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: The text is tokenized and preprocessed (e.g., removing stopwords, lowercasing).
3. **Summarization Algorithm**: Based on NLP techniques (extractive or abstractive summarization), the most relevant sentences or phrases are selected to create a summary.
4. **Summary Output**: The summarized text is generated and presented to the user.

## üìù Usage

- **Command Line**: Run the script directly from the terminal and input text to be summarized.
  
    Example:

    ```bash
    python summarizer.py --text "Your long text goes here"
    ```

- **Web Interface**: (If applicable) Access the web-based summarizer via your browser:

    ```bash
    http://localhost:5000
    ```

## üìä Results

The generated summary will highlight the most important points from the input text, condensing it into a concise format, without losing key information.
